# Expense-tracker
user based expense tracker with python
Expense Tracker Application
________________________________________
Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a Python-based expense tracker that allows users to record, categorize, and analyse their daily expenses.
This project focuses on applying core Python concepts to manage personal finance data and generate meaningful summaries.

Dataset Information
•	Source: User input (self-recorded expense data)
•	Data Type: Text-based records stored using files
•	Key Attributes:
o	Date
o	Expense Category
o	Expense Description
o	Amount Spent
o	Payment Mode (optional)
________________________________________
Tools & Technologies Used
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Concepts Used:
o	Variables & Data Types
o	Conditional Statements
o	Loops
o	Functions
o	Lists & Dictionaries
o	File Handling (read/write)
o	Basic Input/Output Operations
________________________________________
 Data Handling & Validation
•	Ensured valid numerical input for expense amounts
•	Standardized expense categories
•	Handled missing or incorrect user input
•	Stored expense records in a structured format using files
•	Enabled data persistence across program executions

System Functionality
The application supports the following features:
•	Add new expense entries
•	Categorize expenses (Food, Travel, Shopping, Bills, etc.)
•	View total expenses
•	Display category-wise expense breakdown
•	Filter expenses by date or category
•	Store and retrieve expense data from files
